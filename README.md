### Kronkite-Compose

Taking a web-app with sinatra and node back-ends and reverse-proxying it behind nginx. Then dynamically load balancing it with [docker-gen](https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen) as different services scale up or down. Monitoring with Riemann and dashboards with Kibana.

Stress-testing with httperf.
